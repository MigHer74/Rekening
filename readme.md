# Rekening Project

## Description

This is my first project using a graphical interface in Python. I named it "Rekening" because I like how it sounds and according to the translator it means check in Dutch language and this project is to manage and print checks.

It's a very simple project, enter a receptor then enter the information of the check and finally printing the check; after printing all the checks the system store it and you can see all the information of the documents you previously printing.
